## Exercises

This is first issue is an exercise for you to complete:

- [ ] Two sub-sections each (second level heading)

- [ ] Add a footnote to any slide
- [ ] Add an aside to another slide
- [ ] Add a footer to another slide

- [ ] Add an image

Render slides regularly to see your output slides.
